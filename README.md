Quake Clash

In this mod dubbed "Quake Clash" you will act as a tower that you must defend by spawning marines to aid you by using the 1,2,3,4 keys. Across the way you will notice the enemy "tower" in the form of a Network Guardian. The Network Guardian will stay still and send enemy AI to try and take you out. Use your spawnable troops to fend them away and eliminate the enemy tower for the WIN! But be wary that after spawning one of your marines a portion of your "Quake Bar" (essentially the health bar) will go down but will regenerate over time. Don't send out too marines or you will be defenseless!
